# Testing Issues:
Testing works as expected but shows an error while running the code that is related to the chrome driver rather than the tests themselves. This question on Stack Overflow relates to this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65080685/usb-usb-device-handle-win-cc1020-failed-to-read-descriptor-from-node-connectio

Another error occurs when the tests finish executing and the broweser is forcibly closed. Again this does not interfere with the testing code.
